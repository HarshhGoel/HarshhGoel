## Core Problem

</div>

Relocating to a new city presents significant challenges: finding reliable housing without high brokerage fees, sourcing affordable essential appliances, and identifying trustworthy household help. This process is often fragmented, expensive, and stressful for newcomers who lack local contacts and resources.
